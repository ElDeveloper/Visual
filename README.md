#About

A Mac OS X implementation of a simple program to navigate through subsequent images or media in a server. For example, say that you have Image_1.png, Image_2.png ... Image 50.png and you need to navigate through them. 

This is specially useful when running complex algorithms on a server and you need to see and inspect the visual output constantly.
